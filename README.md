## Key Components

### ME3TweaksCoreLib

The main initialization class for the library. You must call `Initialize()` before using any library features:

```csharp
using ME3TweaksCore;

var initPackage = new ME3TweaksCoreLibInitPackage
{
    // Configure initialization parameters
    GetLogger = () => yourLogger,
    LoadAuxiliaryServices = true,
    // ... other options
};

ME3TweaksCoreLib.Initialize(initPackage);
```

### GameTarget

Represents a Mass Effect game installation. Provides access to game files, DLC, and configuration:

```csharp
var gameTarget = new GameTarget(MEGame.LE3, gamePath, registryActive: false);
```

### M3Merge

The merging system allows mods to modify game assets in a compatible way:
- **Bio2DAMerge**: Merge 2DA database tables
- **PlotManagerMerge**: Merge plot manager data
- **SQMOutfitMerge**: Merge squadmate outfit configurations
- **GlobalShaderMerge**: Merge shader configurations

### Localizations

The project includes a PowerShell script that runs before compilation to prepare localization files. Your system must allow running powershell scripts in order for build to succeed.

```powershell
# Automatically run during build
.\ME3TweaksCore\Build\preparelocalizations.ps1
```
